                                  Abstract

     This document provides information about the status of the driver
     and hardware support in XFree86 4.0 compared with that in XFree86
     3.3.6.  Please send updates for this document to
     <fixes@xfree86.org>

1.  Introduction

This document contains one section per vendor (organised alphabetically) for
each chipset family that is supported in XFree86 3.3.6 or XFree86 4.0.  It
includes information about the status of the drivers and the hardware they
support, including a comparison of the level of support between versions
3.3.6 and 4.0.

NOTE: Status information needs to be checked carefully and expanded where
possible.  E.g., include information about acceleration, multi-head, known
problems, hardware known to work on, platform dependencies/limitations, other
architectures known to work on (e.g., Alpha, PPC), etc.

2.  3Dfx

      3.3.6:
            Support (including acceleration) for Voodoo Banshee and Voodoo 3.
            Support is provided by the XF86_SVGA server with the tdfx
            driver).

      4.0:
            Support for Voodoo 1 and Voodoo 2 via glide on platforms where
            glide is available (Linux and FreeBSD(?)).  Support is provided
            by the "glide" driver (requires Glide 2x).

            Support (including acceleration) for Voodoo Banshee and Voodoo 3.
            Support is provided by the "tdfx" driver.

      Summary:
            All hardware supported in 3.3.6 is also supported in 4.0.

3.  3Dlabs

      3.3.6:
            Support (including acceleration) for GLINT 500TX (with IBM RGB526

            ramdacs), Permedia with IBM RGB526 ramdac, Permedia 2, 2a, 2v.
            Support is provided by the XF86_3DLabs server.

      4.0:
            Support (including acceleration) for Permedia, Permedia 2, 2v
            (and 2a??) GLINT 500TX, GLINT MX, GLINT Gamma, and Glint Delta
            coproc.  Support is provided by the "glint" driver.

      Summary:

      4.0:
            Support (including acceleration?) for the AT24, AT25 and AT3D.
            This support is provided by the "apm" driver.  This driver cur-
            rently has only incomplete support for the AP6422.

      Summary:
            The AP6422 is supported in 3.3.6 but not fully in 4.0.  The AT25
            is supported in 4.0 but not in 3.3.6.

            and ARK2000MT.  Support is provided by the XF86_SVGA server with
            the ark driver.

      4.0:
            No native support for these chipsets, because the old driver has
            not been ported.

      Summary:
            No ARK Logic chips are supported in 4.0.

6.  ATI

      3.3.6:
            Accelerated support is provided for the Mach8 chips (by the
            XF86_Mach8 server), Mach32 chips (by the XF86_Mach32 server), the
            following Mach64 and Rage chips: GX, CX, CT, ET, VT, VT3, GT,
            RageII+DVD, RagePro (GB, GD, GI, FP, GQ), VT4, Rage IIC (GV, GW,
            GZ), Rage LT Pro (LD, LB, LI, LP), Rage LT, Rage XL or XC (GL,
            GM, GN, GO, GR, GS) and Rage Mobility (LM, LN, LR, LS) (by the
            XF86_Mach64 server).  Unaccelerated support is provided for most
            of the above (except some early Mach8 and Mach32 adapters), as
            well the old VGAWonder series chipsets (18800, 18800-1, 28800-2,
            28800-4, 28800-5, 28800-6) by the XF86_SVGA server with the ati
            driver.  Accelerated support is provided for the Rage 128 chips
            by the XF86_SVGA server with the r128 driver.

      4.0:

            "r128" driver.  Unaccelerated support is provided for all of the
            others except the Mach8 and some early Mach32 chips by the "ati"
            driver.

      Summary:
            All chips supported in 3.3.6 are supported in 4.0 except for
            Mach8 and some old Mach32 chips.  The support in 4.0 is, however,
            unaccelerated for all chips except the Rage 128.

            Support for the AL2101, ALI2228, ALI2301, ALI2302, ALI2308,
            ALI2401 chipsets.  Support is provided by the XF86_SVGA server,
            using the al2101 driver for the AL2101, and the ali driver for
            the others.  The status of this support is unknown because we
            don't have any recent test reports, and these drivers have no
            maintainer.

      4.0:
            No native support for these chipsets, because the old drivers
            have not been ported.

12.  Epson

      3.3.6:
            Support (accelerated) for the Epson SPC8110 is provided by the
            XF86_SVGA server with the spc8100 driver.

      4.0:
            No native support for this chipset, because the old driver has
            not been ported.

      Summary:
            No Epson chips are supported in 4.0.

13.  Genoa

      3.3.6:
            The old Genoa GVGA chipset is supported by the XF86_SVGA server
            with the gvga driver.  The status of this support is unknown
            because we don't have any recent test reports, and this driver
            has no maintainer.

      4.0:
            No native support for this chipset, because the old driver has
            not been ported.

      Summary:
            No Genoa chips are supported in 4.0.

14.  IBM

      3.3.6:

      4.0:
            Support for the standard IBM VGA chip (and compatibles) is pro-
            vided by the "vga" driver.

            There is no support for the IBM 8514/A or XGA-2 because the
            drivers have not been ported.

      Summary:
            The standard VGA core is supported in both versions, but there is
            no support for the 8514/A or XGA-2 in 4.0.

            with the i810 driver.  The i810 is currently only supported on
            Linux, and requires the agpgart.o kernel module in order to use
            modes that require more than 1MB of video memory.

      4.0:
            Support (accelerated) for the Intel i740 is provided by the
            "i740" driver, and support for the Intel i810 is provided by the
            "i810" driver.  The "i810" driver is currently Linux-only, and
            requires the agpgart.o kernel module.

      Summary:

            is unknown because we don't have any recent test reports, and
            this driver has no maintainer.

      4.0:
            No native support for this chipset, because the old driver has
            not been ported.
