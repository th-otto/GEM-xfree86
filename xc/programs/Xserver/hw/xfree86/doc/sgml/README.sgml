XFree86 is a port of X11R6.4 that supports several UNIX(R) and UNIX-like
operating systems on Intel and other platforms.

<sect>What is XFree86 &relvers;?
<p>

<![ %snapshot [
XFree86 &relvers; is a ``work in progress'' snapshot of the XFree86 4.0
development code.  It is <![ %latersnap; [one of]]>
<![ %firstsnap; [the first in]]>
a series of snapshot releases leading up the the 4.0 release.  The
plan is to release a new snapshot every four to six weeks.  The target
audience for this release is developers and others who are comfortable
on the bleeding edge.  This release is not targeted at beginners.
Also, most end users will find life easier using our latest 3.3.x release.
While we welcome bug reports and feedback about this release, we don't
have the resources to provide user-level support for it.  If you're not
comfortable dealing with those sorts of things yourself, then the snapshot
releases are probably not for you.

This code is very much work in progress.  Many of the interfaces may
change without notice between now and the 4.0 release.  The
<htmlurl name="driver design" url="DESIGN.html"> has changed significantly
compared with the 3.3.x versions, and only a small number of drivers have
been converted so far.  That means that this release does not support a
wide range of video hardware.  Some of the drivers and new features are
well developed and reasonably stable, while others are not.
]]>

<![ %release [
XFree86 &relvers; is <![ %firstrel; [the first]]>
<![ %laterrel; [a]]> full release of the <![ %earlyrel; [new]]> XFree86 4
series.
The road to XFree86 4 began in mid 1997, with serious work starting in
early 1998.  The first pre-4.0 snapshot was released in mid 1999, and
4.0 was released in early 2000.  A lot has been completed in that time,
and even more has been started since the "4.0" design was drafted.  The
result is that this release contains a lot of new features, some new
drivers, and some significant performance improvements.  This release
contains components in various stages of development, ranging from stable
and well tested to new and not-so-well tested.  One the other side,
there are drivers from the 3.3.x series that have not yet been ported
to XFree86 4.  Most of these are for old hardware.  To find more
information about which hardware is supported, see the <htmlurl
name="Driver Status document" url="Status.html">.

XFree86 4 uses a very modular design.  We had hoped to finalise and fully
document the driver module API/ABI in time for the 4.0 release, but instead
we are planning to have this done for a subsequent release.  We will try
where possible to retain backward compatibility with the module interfaces
in 4.0 in future releases, but we can't make guarantees about that until
the interfaces have been fully documented.

Information on this release's features and their status can be found in
the <htmlurl name="Release Notes" url="RELNOTES.html">.

Information about obtaining and installing binary distributions of this
release can be found in the <htmlurl name="Installation Document"

<sect>Redistribution of the Snapshots
<p>

While the XFree86 <htmlurl name="License" url="LICENSE.html"> doesn't
prohibit vendors and others redistributing binaries of this release, we
don't recommend it.  We ask that if you do distribute such binaries,
you make it clear that people using then should contact you for support
and not XFree86.

<sect>Developers
<p>

If you would like to work on the development of XFree86 4, then it is
recommended that you <url name="join the XFree86 development team"
url="http://www.xfree86.org:/developer.html">.  That way you will have
access to the latest source and to other developers.

<sect>How to get XFree86 &relvers;
<p>

<![ %snapshot; [
XFree86 &relvers; can be found at the <url name="XFree86 ftp server"
url="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/snapshots/&relvers;/">, and at
mirrors of this server.  This snapshot is available primarily in source
form.  Binaries for some platforms may be made available at a later
time.
]]>

<![ %release; [
XFree86 &relvers; can be found at the <url name="XFree86 ftp server"
url="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/&relvers;/">,
and at mirrors of this server.  Information about obtaining and installing
binary distributions of this release can be found in the
<htmlurl name="Installation Document" url="Install.html">.  Information about
obtaining the release in source form is given below.
]]>

The source for version &relvers; is split into three tarballs:
<tt>X&srcvers;src-1.tgz</tt>, <tt>X&srcvers;src-2.tgz</tt>,
<tt>X&srcvers;src-3.tgz</tt>.  The first contains everything except the
fonts and general X11 documentation.  It is sufficient for building
XFree86 is you already have a set of fonts.  The second contains the
fonts and the source for the general X11 documentation.  The third
contains the general X11 documentation in hardcopy format.

<![ %onediff; [
A source patch relative to version &prevrelvers; is also available.
The patch file is <tt>&prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff.gz</tt>.  This patch should
be applied to a clean &prevrelvers; source tree, working from the directory
containing the <tt>xc/</tt> directory.  The patch should be applied by
running:

<tscreen><verb>
gunzip &lt; &prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff.gz | patch -p0 -E
</verb></tscreen>
]]>

<![ %twodiffs; [
A source patch relative to version &prevrelvers; is also available.
Because of its size, it is split into two parts.
The patch files are <tt>&prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff1.gz</tt> and
<tt>&prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff2.gz</tt>.  These patches should
be applied to a clean &prevrelvers; source tree, working from the directory
containing the <tt>xc/</tt> directory.  The patches should be applied by
running:

<tscreen><verb>
gunzip &lt; &prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff1.gz | patch -p0 -E
gunzip &lt; &prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff2.gz | patch -p0 -E
</verb></tscreen>
]]>

<![ %threediffs; [
A source patch relative to version &prevrelvers; is also available.
Because of its size, it is split into three parts.
The patch files are <tt>&prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff1.gz</tt>,
<tt>&prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff2.gz</tt> and
<tt>&prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff3.gz</tt>.  These patches should

gunzip &lt; &prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff3.gz | patch -p0 -E
</verb></tscreen>

The contrib part of the distribution has now been folded into the main
source tree, so a separate contrib tarball is no longer required.

To format the XFree86 documentation, the latest version of our doctools
package.  That is available as <tt>doctools-1.1.2.tgz</tt>.

<sect>Reporting Bugs
<p>

Bugs should be reported to <email>XFree86@XFree86.org</email>.  Before
reporting bugs, please check the X server log file, which can be found
at <tt>/var/log/XFree86.0.log</tt> on most platforms.  If you can't resolve
the problem yourself, send the entire log file with your bug report.  Please
don't edit out what you think might not be important.  The information
contained in the log file is there to make it easier for the developers
to determine what is going wrong when there are problems.

If you have patches (bug fixes or enhancements, etc) that you'd like to
submit for inclusion in a future version of XFree86, please send them
to <email>fixes@XFree86.org</email>.
