                         r128 Driver Version 3.0.0



1. Supported Hardware

    * ATI Rage 128 based cards


2. Features

    * Full support (including hardware accelerated 2D drawing) for 8, 15,
      16, 24, and 32 bit per pixel depths.
    * Hardware cursor support to reduce sprite flicker.
    * Support for high resolution video modes up to 1800x1440 @ 70Hz.
    * Support for doublescan video modes (e.g., 320x200 and 320x240).
    * Support for gamma correction at all pixel depths.
    * Fully programmable clock supported.
    * Robust text mode restore for VT switching.


3. Technical Notes

    * None


4. Reported Working Video Cards

    * Rage Fury AGP 32MB
    * XPERT 128 AGP 16MB
    * XPERT 99 AGP 8MB


5. Configuration

   The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to
   initialize the card.  The only lines you need in the "Device"
   section of your XF86Config file are:

       Section "Device"
           Identifier "Rage 128"
           Driver     "r128"
       EndSection

   or let xf86config or XF86Setup do this for you.

   However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:

       VideoRam - in kilobytes
       MemBase  - physical address of the linear framebuffer
       IOBase   - physical address of the memory mapped IO registers
       ChipID   - PCI DEVICE ID


6. Driver Options

   "hw_cursor" - request hardware cursor (default)
   "sw_cursor" - software cursor only
   "noaccel"   - software rendering only (no hardware acceleration)
   "dac_8_bit" - use color weight 888 in 8 bpp mode (default)
   "dac_6_bit" - use color weight 666 in 8 bpp mode (VGA emulation)


7. Known Limitations

    * DGA is not supported yet

    The XFree86 3.3 driver was funded by ATI and was donated to The
    XFree86 Project by Precision Insight, Inc.  It was based in part on
    an earlier driver that was written by:

    * Alan Hourihane alanh@fairlite.demon.co.uk
    * Dirk Hohndel <hohndel@suse.de>

    This early driver was funded and  donated to The XFree86 Project by:
